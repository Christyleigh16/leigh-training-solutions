# Leigh Training Solutions


My First Milestone Project for Code Institute is a website that I have created for my limited company. We specialise in clinical system configuration and training. Clinical systems play a huge part in health care and the NHS, from maximising patient care to maximising income.

# UX

#### Who is the target audience?  
- GP Practices looking for help with the day to day running on their surgeries
- Other systems specialist looking to enhance their knowledge.
- Primary care networks looking for a workable integrated solution

#### Why is this the best way to target the audience?
The website is designed to bring custom in by piquing the users interest and questioning whether they could be doing more with their clinical systems. Are they getting enough income coming in or are they missing out on easy money?
The website encourages the user to get in touch and find out where they are missing out.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to know my specialists work history
2. As a user, I want to know what you can do for me.
3. As a user, I want to be able to find training materials easily.
4. As a user, I want to be able to make contact easily.

### Features Left to Implement

- Add a payment feature for subscription packages.
- Live chat to provide on hand help that can be accessed via mobile devices
- Training packages for Primary Care Networks
- GDPR compliant pop-up screen to make sure the website complies with European law.


## Testing
- Used Google Chrome developer tools to test website responsiveness across multiple devices such as Tablets and Mobiles.
-
- Used [W3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate both HTML and CSS. I copied my code and pasted it into the validator to check for errors and warnings.
- Used [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) to test the website across multiple browsers. I used this to test my site on opera and safari as I don't have these browsers available.

### Issues when Testing
- The home page doesn't respond in the same way that the other pages do, the navbar seem to be leaking over at ipad breakpoint.
- The hamburger menu didn't drop down. Checked bootstrap code to correct this but couldn't correct.
- Getting a responsive layout proved difficult
